### What is Bash?

Bash (acronym for **Bourne-Again SHell**) is the shell, or command language interpreter for the GNU operating system. It is largely compatible with `sh` (original command-line interpreter) and incorporates useful features from other shell implementations such as `ksh` (Korn shell) and `csh` (C shell).

Bash is the default shell of the GNU operating system. It is quite portable, and currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems.
